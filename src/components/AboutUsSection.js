        Tarracore is Ireland's newest Farm and Plant machinery competition
        website. Located in the Midlands, our mission is to source the best
        Irish registered farm and plant machinery as prizes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our name is dervied from the Gaelic word for tractor, known as
        "Tarrac√≥ir". We decided to simplify the translation to make our brand
        easier to share across the web.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are passionate about all things farm and agriculture related,
        especially tractors! Please help us get better, share your ideas on what
        you'd like to see as prizes.
